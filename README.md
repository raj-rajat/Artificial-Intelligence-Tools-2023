# AI Tools Dataset Analysis üìä

Welcome to the AI Tools Dataset analysis repository! This project explores a comprehensive collection of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and provides insights into their characteristics and usage.

## üìã Dataset Overview

The "5000 AI Tools Dataset" is a valuable resource containing information about a wide range of AI tools, including their names, descriptions, pricing models, use cases, and more. This analysis aims to answer several questions and hypotheses about the dataset.

## üßê Hypothesis

**Hypothesis 1:** The distribution of AI tools across different major categories will provide insights into the diversity of AI applications.

**Hypothesis 2:** The pricing models of AI tools will vary, and this analysis will uncover trends in pricing across different categories.

**Hypothesis 3:** There may be a relationship between the number of reviews a tool receives and its pricing.

## üìà Results

### Major Categories Distribution

We found that the dataset covers a diverse range of AI applications, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Data Analytics, and more. The distribution of AI tools across major categories confirmed Hypothesis 1, highlighting the breadth of AI applications.

### Pricing Model Analysis

Our analysis of pricing models revealed that AI tools are available in various pricing categories, including Free, Paid, Freemium, and others. This confirmed Hypothesis 2 and showed that the AI tool market offers options for different budget ranges.

### Reviews vs. Pricing

Surprisingly, our analysis did not find a significant correlation between the number of reviews and pricing. This suggests that users may choose AI tools based on factors other than just price, such as functionality, features, or brand reputation.

### Word Cloud of Descriptions

A word cloud of AI tool descriptions provided insights into the most frequent terms used in tool descriptions. Terms such as "generate," "content," "create," and "platform" suggest a focus on generative capabilities and diverse content types.

### Major Category Box Plot

The Box Plot analysis of charges (pricing) across major categories revealed pricing trends within each category. Some categories had a wider pricing range than others.

### Sunburst Chart

The Sunburst Chart displayed the hierarchical structure of AI tool categories, allowing users to explore major categories and subcategories interactively.

### Histogram of Reviews

The Histogram of the number of reviews for AI tools provided insights into the popularity distribution of tools.
